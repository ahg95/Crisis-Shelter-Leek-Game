How to set up a new task:

Creation
1. Create a new Task > right click in Project > Create > Tasks > New Task.

Details
2. Set up the details of the task in the newly made constructor. 
 > You can simply drag in any task that is a 'conditional' task to be performed in the constructor.
* MAKE SURE you assign it an ID that isn't already used with another task.

Keep it tidy!
3. Put the new task in the correct folder. Keep it tidy!

Set up Task Giver
4. Give the object that gives the tasks the Task Giver Component and drag in this new task (and others if multiple).

Assign task to player
5. You need a component in the task giver that calls the 'AssignTasks' void of the Task Giver component. A simple example being a button's 'OnClick' void => drag in the Task Giver component and make it call AssignTasks.

Perform Task
To set up the trigger for the task to be performed, get a class(script) on the object that will trigger the action. Set up a parameter of the task that needs to be performed. (make a serialize field of the task that needs to be performed and drag it in). 
Then, call the static void 'PerformTask.TryPerForm(taskToPerform);'
The 'TaskToPerform' is the task parameter that you dragged in yourself in the inspector as a parameter of the void you call.

Done! This should call the task.
